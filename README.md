# text-summarization-project

Here I have implemented an end to end text summarization project. The model is the google peaguses model from huggingface. I finetuned a corpus of data with the model to achieve good results.

I have also deployed the model as an endpoint with the fastapi to docker which makes it easily deployable to the AWS ECR and subsequently scaled with the AWS EC2.

The continuous integration and depolyment is done with the help of githuub actions where I have kept all my AWS secret code.

This project is just a sample done with text-summarization. It can be improved for various use cases.

Thank you
